              automated system to access the Services in a manner that sends more request messages to the Qoral servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Qoral grants
              the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from publicly accessible web pages at Qoral.com for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable

              publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable,
              inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Qoral shall not be liable for any damages you may incur as a result of User Content. </p>
            <p> By posting any User Content on the Services, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have a right to grant, to Qoral a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license
